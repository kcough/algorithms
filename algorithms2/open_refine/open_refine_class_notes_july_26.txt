text facets: value counts (facet --> text facet) breaks out all of the different categories within a category
sort by name, by count

bad column --> good column:
click drop down on menu on column --> edit column --> add column based on this column (always keep your original columns)
Add column based on column Amount:


openrefine:
you can import requests, 
Set new column name:
Expression: [value] write: return float(value.replace('$','').replace(','','')) [we're saying get rid of the dollar sign, turn it into a float and replace the commas in the numbers]
Language: Change it from 'General refine Expression Language' to Python 


set new column name:
you can get your row as a dictionary using cells:
return cell['last/business name']['value']
you're saying give me the row ['row name'] and the value from that row ['value']


return cells.keys
if "First Name" in cells:
    first = cells["First Name"]["value"]
else:
first = " "


IN THE EXPRESSION BOX

try:
    first = cells["First Name"]["value"]
except:
    first = " "

try:
    last = cells["Last/Business Name"]["value"]
except:
    last = " "
return first + " " + last


dropdown --> EDIT CELLS --> common transformation --> trim leading/trailing whitespace


dropdown --> edit cells --> cluster and edit (DONT DO THIS ON YOUR COLUMN MAKE A NEW ONE WITH THE INFO)




useful things to do:

1. standardize the case: text transform lowercase (will help you tell it's the same)
2. alphabetize the string of words
3. get rid of repeating words
4. edit distance / levenshtein distance : how many things you have to change to go from one thing to another e.g. alaska charr pac to alaksa chrr pac is 2 edit/levenshtein distances because it requires two edits to get there



NEXT: running openrefine on our own servers

openrefine.org/download.html

1) right click on linux and get the address https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.7/openrefine-linux-2.7.tar.gz
2) on your external server: wget https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.7/openrefine-linux-2.7.tar.gz
3) tar xvzf openrefine-linux-2.7.tar.gz
4) cd openrefine-2.7/
5) ./refine means look in my current directory for something called refine
6)  apt install -y default-jre
7) our server doesn't have enough ram to run this stuff. so we're going to make a snapshot of it (because it has things we need on it) and we're going to. so go back to digital ocean click snapshots
8) so we powered down the droplet
9) took a snapshot of it
10) created a new server that was bigger except not really
11) get onto your new server: ssh -i ~/.ssh/algorithms_key root@174.138.42.162 note the different root key
12) open open refine with command:  ~/openrefine-2.7/refine

ssh -i ~/.ssh/algorithms_key root@174.138.42.162
