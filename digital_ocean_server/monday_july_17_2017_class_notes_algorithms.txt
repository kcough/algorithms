AWS: Amazon web services: a bunch of computers. 30% of the internet

VPS: Virtual private server

1. We created a digital ocean scraping server here: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7b89f9a41799&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=CopyPaste
email: kaitlin.cough@gmail.com p: L9e8m706$

2. Then we created a Droplet, which is basically a server. Note: Cloud server is a just a computer connected to the internet. We chose a size.
Block storage: if you want to transfer data
Region: if you pick newer data centers (like Bangalore, for instance) might be better. they probably go down for maintenance less.
Additional options: didn't select any of these

3. SSH Keys: you have a public and private key. Generate a key pair. This saves a public and private key on your computer. The private one stays on your computer.

We ran this command in the terminal: ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/algorithms_key -t rsa -b 4096

While in Finder (anywhere), we held down: command + shift + g
and entered: ~/.ssh

or this:
command + shift + . 
will show you hidden files!

Open algorithms_pub.key in the text editor

Copy/paste that into the SSH key area on digital ocean. Call it whatever you want.

We're going to interact with our server via the command line.

SETTING UP THE SERVER

need to change shell to server
on command line type: ssh -i ~/.ssh/algorithms_key root@67.205.133.233

When you start a server you want to login with root, which is the god on the machine root is the user we're logging in as
Get the IP address from digital ocean: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets?i=3b99f8

answer yes

Next we copy/pasted this into the terminal window: 

echo "export PS1=\"\[\033[40m\]\[\033[47m\]server\[\033[0m\] \[\033[31m\]\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h\[\033[0m\]:\w\$ \"" > ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

We ran this in the terminal window: 

apt update
apt -y upgrade

Then this:





.... way later
